</p>

**AI enterprise gateway** implemented in Rust 🦀 that provides secure access to LLM and compliance controls for AI systems.
It will help organizations to manage their **AI governance** in a secure and compliant way.

The goal is to provide for employees, unit and project access to
cloud based LLM providers or self-hosted models via that single entrypoint, it can be seen as a reverse firewall.

## Configuration 

The configuration file `conf.yml` is used to define the models, the quotas, the providers, the tokens, the rate limits, 
the groups, the PII protection, the blacklisted words and the Prometheus metrics.

Here is an example of part of a configuration file:
```yaml
models:
  - location: "/echo/chat/completions"
    model_name: "echo"
    proxy_pass: "http://localhost:9999"
    api_key: "$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
    parser: "ollama"
    disabled_groups: "mammals, birds"
    blacklist_words: "confidential, mycorp"
    pii_protection_url: "http://127.0.0.1:8001/check-pii-base64"
    quotas:
      - max_tokens:
          minute: 500
          hour: 6000
          day: 10000
          week: 40000
      - max_requests:
          second: 1
          minute: 15
```

Here is an example of a curl request to the gateway:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6189/echo/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "echo",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Bonjour le monde"}]
  }'
```
