- [Cost Management with Quotas](#cost-management)
- [Preventing Data Leakage](#data-leakage-prevention)

### Departmental Access Control
Let's consider an organization with three departments:

| Department | Access Level | Restrictions |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| IT         | All models   | Quotas & rate limits |
| Finance    | Self-hosted only | No external models |
| HR         | All models   | Unlimited budget |

- Alice works in the IT Department
- Bob works in the Finance Department
- Charlie works in the Human Resources Department

The organization's governance rules are configured as follows:

- The IT Department has access to all models, with quotas and rate limits
- The Finance Department does not have access to external models only self-hosted.
- The Human Resources Department has access to all models with unlimited budget

### Cost Management with Quotas

Administrators can effectively control costs by configuring **quotas** for model usage and user access.

**Key Features:**

- **Per-Model Quotas**: Set usage limits for individual models to manage resource allocation.

This granular approach allows administrators to optimize costs while maintaining flexibility and control over system resources.



```yaml
models:
  - location: "/echo"
    model_name: "echo"
    proxy_pass: "http://localhost:9999"
    api_key: "$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
    parser: "ollama"
    disabled_groups: "mammals, birds"
    blacklist_words: "confidential, mycorp"
    pii_protection_url: "http://127.0.0.1:8001/check-pii-base64"
    quotas:
      - max_tokens:
          minute: 500
          hour: 6000
          day: 10000
          week: 40000
      - max_requests:
          second: 1
          minute: 15
```
